    <h2>The War On Terry</h2>
    <p>​by Hugh Dichmont</p>

<div class="box row uniform">

        <blockquote>
            My girlfriend thinks I’m obsessed with death. Well maybe I am, but only as much as the next rotting sack of bones.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            It’s Terry’s birthday. At 27, he is now older than his older brother Danny.
        </p>
        <p>
            With a shoebox full of dead ladybirds, Terry reminisces over their childhood, whilst fighting to come to terms with his regrets over how things could have been different. A darkly comic monologue about boys, Christmas socks and not growing up.
