We're thrilled to announce that INFLUENCING MACHINE is to be supported using public funding by the National Lottery through Arts Council England, to make our debut show The War On Terry, and take it on a tour of the Midlands.

Originally previewed at Nottingham Playhouse’s Playground Festival in October 2017, The War On Terry is a one-person show that uses the lens of a sibling rivalry to explore the themes of suicide and family bereavement. 1 in 4 people in the UK will experience a mental health problem each year*. Our production, developed in support of charity partner The Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM), seeks to challenge prejudices around mental health, provoking discussion and raising awareness about support services such as CALM.

Drawing on his family’s relationship to mental illness, INFLUENCING MACHINE artistic director and writer of The War On Terry, Hugh Dichmont, found comedy the best approach to addressing such a difficult subject: 
>“I couldn’t have written a completely straight-faced play about depression. Life doesn’t work like that, in my experience. From the beginning I knew there had to be laughs to lighten the dark. I am so grateful to Arts Council England’s offer to fund our show, to ensure a wide range of people will see this production take life.”

The show is performed by Nottingham actor, writer and voice artist Steve Conlin. 

Ahead of its confirmed tour to Derbyshire and a run in London, The War On Terry will now undergo a period of dramaturgy, whilst the project also takes on costume, set, lighting and sound designers, and a director in Louisa Sanfey.

#### Confirmed tour dates:
15th-17th July, Underground at The Clubhouse, as part of Buxton Festival Fringe.  
8th-12th August at Landor_Space (London)  
More dates TBC
